Sometimes you need to handle a **large set of network equipements** in your company, but graph a strong **visualization** of dependency and connections between services/network/... is quite hard. 

We are introducing the concept of clusters to express the network, a cluster is a set of objects that has subscribed to a topic.

OpenNetInventory is only an API you can use to your extend your actual toolset.

Database powered by Neo4j 
## Key concepts
